readme for sap pool table source
dsgg - dsg done is sqlplus land
enc.pl - encoding perl script - will need parameters at some point or to be modularized, etc.
make_list.sh - script to make a listing for testing purposes
readme.txt - this file
step1.sql - step1 to run as a dba.  There will be a separate set of scripts to run as sapsr3 directly.
supergrep - greps that have some greps ignored.  Have to go through these again though.
